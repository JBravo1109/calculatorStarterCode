This calculator is capable of performing basic arithmetic and generating a random number. It can also find the square root of a number, and raise a number to a specific degree. The calculator is capable of this due to functions that were created in order for it to carry out the process. If I had more time, I would attempt to add trigonometric functions to the calculator.
